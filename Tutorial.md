## Summary

<!-- Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary. -->

REGEX, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern, 
like  ``` /[0-9a-z]/gi ```, which will look for every instance of numbers 0-9, and letters a-z, ignoring case sensitivity.

These patters can be used to manipualte strings in many ways such as finding characters, replacing characters, validating user input, and more.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are a type of character that specify something about the string or how the search pattern should be implemented. For example, there are anchors that allow you to look for a match at the end of a string or line ``` $ ```, the beginning ``` ^ ```, and more.

Anchors do not have to be in a specific place in regex, and can be used multiple times in the same expression. For example, you can wirte and expression like 

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers in regular expressions specify how many times a character, group of characters, or type of characters need to appear for there to be a match.  


### Grouping Constructs
Grouping Constructs symbolize a subexpression inside a regular expression. Done by using *paranthesis* ```  ( ) ```, Grouping Constructs allow more specific manipulations of a string by breaking it down into substrings. 

### Bracket Expressions


### Character Classes
Character classes define characters or sets of characters in which a regular expression must or must not contain a match.

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
