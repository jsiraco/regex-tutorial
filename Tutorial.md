<!-- Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary. -->

These patters can be used to manipualte strings in many ways such as finding characters, replacing characters, validating user input, and more.

Anchors do not have to be in a specific place in regex, and can be used multiple times in the same expression. For example, you can wirte and expression like
